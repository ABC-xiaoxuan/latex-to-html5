Latex to HTML5
==============

This repository contains configuration files for tex4ht and post processing
scripts to customize and simplify the HTML generated by tex4ht. Instead of
preserving the full generality of Latex, it seems to be a better approach for
the Web to concentrate on the semantic elements and provide a suitable CSS file.


### Requirements

 - tex4ht
 - tidy
 - Python
 - Perl
